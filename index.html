		<p>There are many different types of functions available in Google Sheets, each with a different purpose. Google spreadsheet functions can be used to perform mathematical operations, manipulate text strings, or even fetch data from other sources.</p>

		<p>Using functions is a great way to automate repetitive tasks in your spreadsheet. By creating a formula using one or more functions, you can save yourself the hassle of manually performing the same calculation every time you need it.</p>

		<p>To use a function in your spreadsheet, simply type the function name followed by an open parenthesis. After you type the function name, Google Sheets will automatically insert the correct number of arguments for that function. Simply enter the values for each argument and then close the parenthesis.<p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><em>For example, the SUM function takes up to 30 arguments and returns the sum of all the values you enter. To use the SUM function, you would type =SUM( followed by the cells that you want to add up, separated by commas. Finally, close the parenthesis with a ).</em></p>
